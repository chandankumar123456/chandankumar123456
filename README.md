# Hi there, I'm Chandan Kumar! 👋

🎓 I'm a 3rd-year B.Tech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence at Anurag University. I'm passionate about all things AI, especially in **NLP** and **Computer Vision**. My long-term goal is to become a **Data Scientist**, diving deep into the realms of AI to make a tangible impact.

- 🔭 Currently working on projects involving **deep learning, computer vision, and OpenCV**.
- 🌱 Exploring advanced **OpenCV concepts** like `contours`, `RETR_EXTERNAL`, `CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE`, `getPerspectiveTransform`, and `warpPerspective`.
- 🧠 I’m diving into **generative AI** and learning **advanced deep learning techniques** for applications like text-to-image generation.
- 💬 Ask me about **machine learning, AI project workflows**, and **TensorFlow**.
- 📚 Preparing for GATE DA and aiming to build a strong foundation in **DBMS**, **Data Warehousing**, and **AI fundamentals**.
